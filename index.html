        What is a Supermoon and When Does it Occur?
    </h1>
    <h2>
        There will be four Supermoons during 2023
    </h2>
    <p>
        A Supermoon occurs when a full moon occurs at the same time as when the moon's perigree or orbit is at its
        closest to earth. This causes the full moon to appear up to 30 percent brighter and 14 percent larger than a
        regular full moon. The next Supermoon of this year is predicted to occur on September 29 and it will be the last
        of four this year.

        NASA Announces the names of the Crew for Artemis II, the next Moon Mission
    </h2>
    <p>
        There will be four astronauts on the Artemis II Mission: NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and
        Christina Hammock Koch, and CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen.The approximately 10-day Artemis II flight test will
        launch on the agency’s powerful Space Launch System rocket, prove the Orion spacecraft’s life-support systems,
        and validate the capabilities and techniques needed for humans to live and work in deep space. Artemis II will
        set the stage for the first woman and first person of color on the Moon through the Artemis program, paving the
        way for future for long-term human exploration missions to the Moon, and eventually Mars.

        The James Webb Space Telescope
    </h3>
    <p>
        NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has begun the study of one of the most renowned supernovae, SN 1987A
        (Supernova 1987A). Located 168,000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, SN 1987A has been a target of
        intense observations at wavelengths ranging from gamma rays to radio for nearly 40 years, since its discovery in
        February of 1987. New observations by Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) provide a crucial clue to our
        understanding of how a supernova develops over time to shape its remnant. So far it has identified never seen
        before crescent shapes that are thought to be gas that was ejected from the supernova's explosion. Before Webb,
        the now-retired Spitzer telescope observed this supernova in infrared throughout its entire lifespan, yielding
        key data about how its emissions evolved over time. However, it was never able to observe the supernova with
        such clarity and detail.
