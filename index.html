            What is a Supermoon and When Does it Occur?
        </h1>
        <h2>
            There will be four Supermoons during 2023
        </h2>
        <p>
            A Supermoon occurs when a full moon occurs at the same time as when the 
            moon's perigree or orbit is at its closest to earth. This causes the full moon
            to appear up to 30 percent brighter and 14 percent larger than a regular
            full moon. The next Supermoon of this year is predicted to occur on September
            29 and it will be the last of four this year.
